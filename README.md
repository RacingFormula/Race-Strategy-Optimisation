# Race Strategy Optimisation

This repository organises various projects exploring race strategy optimisation techniques in motorsport. Each project addresses a unique challenge, such as pit stop timing, fuel load management, and energy deployment strategies.

## Projects

### 1. [Dynamic Pit Strategy Optimiser](https://github.com/RacingFormula/Dynamic-Pit-Strategy-Optimiser)
Optimises pit stop strategies using dynamic programming, Monte Carlo simulations, and Bayesian optimisation to minimise race time.

### 2. [Fuel Load Strategy](https://github.com/RacingFormula/Fuel-Load-Strategy)
Explores the trade-offs between fuel load, car weight, and lap time to optimise race performance.

### 3. [Safety Car Strategy Simulator](https://github.com/RacingFormula/Safety-Car-Strategy-Simulator)
Simulates optimal strategies during safety car periods, accounting for time gaps and tyre temperature changes.

### 4. [Energy Management Model](https://github.com/RacingFormula/Energy-Management-Model)
Models energy deployment strategies for electric race vehicles, focusing on efficient energy usage across race distances.

### 5. [Overtaking Probability Model](https://github.com/RacingFormula/Overtaking-Probability-Model)
Predicts overtaking opportunities using track layout, car performance, and driver behavior data.
